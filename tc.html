        </div>
        <div>

            <p>
                By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re
                not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app,
                or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
                to extract the source code of the app, and you also
                shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or
                make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade
                marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
                property rights related to it, still belong to
                Yagnyam eCommerce LLP.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yagnyam eCommerce LLP is committed to ensuring that the app
                is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge
                for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will
                never charge you for the app or its services without making
                it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
            </p>
            <p>
                The SMS Gateway app stores and processes personal data
                that you have provided to us, in order to provide
                our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
                phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
                that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
                process of removing software restrictions and limitations
                imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
                could make your phone vulnerable to
                malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                security features and it could mean that the
                SMS Gateway app won’t work properly or at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should be aware that there are certain things that
                Yagnyam eCommerce LLP will not take responsibility for.
                Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an
                active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
                provided by your mobile network provider, but
                Yagnyam eCommerce LLP cannot take responsibility for the
                app not working at full functionality if you don’t have
                access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
                allowance left.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
                may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
                for the duration of the connection while accessing the app,
                or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re
                accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
                roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
                territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
                roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
                which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume
                that you have received permission from the bill payer for
                using the app.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the same lines, Yagnyam eCommerce LLP cannot always
                take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
                need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
                runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
                Service, Yagnyam eCommerce LLP cannot accept
                responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                With respect to Yagnyam eCommerce LLP’s responsibility for
                your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
                important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
                ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
                rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
                we can make it available to you.
                Yagnyam eCommerce LLP accepts no liability for any loss,
                direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
                wholly on this functionality of the app.
            </p>
            <p>
                At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
                both systems (and for any additional systems we
                decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                using the app. Yagnyam eCommerce LLP does not promise that
                it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
                may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate
                use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
                to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
                (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
                will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
                delete it from your device.
